        Dear employment service provider!<br>
        I would like to apply for the job you have advertised.  
        What you need to know about me, I am still in high school, studying Python, I have not done a similar range of work because of my age and because I have worked in the mechi, but I would like to work as a developer so that I can do as much programming as possible.  I like to do this, what I am good at is Python, Kotlin, C/C++, C#, SQL, py.SQlite3, WEB "programming" (html, css, pyscript, javascript); I am also familiar with the Linux operating system, I have only been using it for 2 and a half years, but I also have Windows.  Within Python, I've mostly worked with OpenCV, PyGame, OS, SQLite3, and the basic libraries (Random, math, net-tools, server, etc.), I want to make sure I'm capable of doing such a job, mostly to learn more about the job I want to do.<br>
        <br><br><br>
        Thanks in advance for your feedback!<br>
        Have a nice day!
        </p>
